When the installation is complete and user created with sudo access, change to this user and download this script.

Download the script and run the script as per below.

bash nimiq-client-install.sh

The scrypt will ask you to enter detials for the client. You will be required to sudo which means entering your user password. 

DO NOT RUN THIS AS ROOT.

When complete, change to the core directory.

Start the Nimiq mining client by typing ./start.

If you need to change any settings, you can do this by editing the start file.

Have fun :)
