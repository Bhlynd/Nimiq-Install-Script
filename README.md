## Howto

When the installation is complete and user created with sudo access, **change to the new user** and download this script.

Run the script as per below.

**bash nimiq-client-install.sh**

The scrypt will ask you to enter detials for the client. You will be required to sudo which means entering your user password. 

**DO NOT RUN THIS AS ROOT**

When complete, **change to the core directory**.

Start the Nimiq mining client by typing **./start**.

If you need to change any settings, you can do this by editing the start file.

Have fun :)
